You aren't alone cuz GBX turned it into a skill tree.\nWell then Slip N' Dip Amon is for you. Activate all of your kill skills right off the bat with some fish.\nThis will shape up to be THE standard Amon gun build. Using proper weapons in combination with an easy to maintain loop this build is exceedingly powerful and easy to run. Requires little game knowledge once the skills are specced and the items are acquired.",
